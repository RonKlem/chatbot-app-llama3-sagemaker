# Chatbot Project with LLaMa3 and AWS SageMaker

## Overview
This project implements a chatbot leveraging the LLaMa3 model and AWS SageMaker. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent responses based on context and user queries. It integrates a vector database for efficient similarity search and uses SageMaker for model deployment and predictions.
